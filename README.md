# leadprevalence.uk
This repository contains the ECLIPS project website, available at `leadprevalence.uk`. For now we've kept things simple: it's just a basic landing page with minimal styling, constructed from a single text file called `index.md`. We can easily transition to something more elaborate later on.

## First-time Setup (One-time steps)

1. Create a GitHub account at [github.com/signup](https://github.com/signup)
2. Email your GitHub username to Frank to get access to this repository
3. Learn the basics of Markdown (it's easy!):
   - Read this [5-minute Markdown tutorial](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
   - Try it out in this [live editor](https://markdownlivepreview.com/)

## How to Edit the Website

### Editing Text
1. Go to `index.md` in this repository
2. Click the pencil icon (✏️) to edit
3. Make your changes
4. Scroll down to "Commit changes"
5. Add a brief description of what you changed (e.g., "Updated contact info")
6. Click "Commit changes"
7. Wait about 1-2 minutes for `leadprevalence.uk` to update

### Adding Images
1. Go to the `assets` folder
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag your image files or click to select them
   - Use clear names like `team-photo-2024.jpg` (no spaces in filenames!)
   - Images should be less than 5MB in size
   - Common formats: .jpg, .png, .gif
4. Click "Commit changes"
5. To use the image in the website, add this line to `index.md`:
   ```markdown
   ![Description of image](assets/your-image-name.jpg)
   ```

### Preview Your Changes
